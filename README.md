Building Packed
---------------

The source code can be cloned using [git](http://git-scm.com/) from GitHub:

```
  git clone https://github.com/packedapp/packed.git
```

This project uses [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) as the build system.
To install and compile the source code locally, run:

```
  mvn install
```

Note that Packed requires Java 11 to compile and run. In the future it is expected that minimum Java version will be 9.
